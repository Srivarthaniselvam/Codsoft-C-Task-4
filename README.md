# Codsoft-C-Task-4
# To Do List Application

# Explanation:

This C++ program is a simple To-Do List application implemented with classes. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and removing tasks.

# Key Features:

1. **Task Class:**
   - The `Task` class represents a single task with properties like title, description, and completion status.

2. **ToDoList Class:**
   - The `ToDoList` class encapsulates a collection of tasks (represented as a vector).
   - It provides methods for adding tasks, viewing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and removing tasks.

3. **User Interface:**
   - The `runToDoList` function serves as the main interface for users.
   - Users can add tasks by providing a title and description.
   - They can view the list of tasks, mark a task as completed, and remove a task.

# Example Workflow:

1. The user is welcomed to the To-Do List application.
2. The user is presented with a menu to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, or remove tasks.
3. When adding a task, the user inputs the title and description.
4. The user can view the list of tasks along with their completion status.
5. Tasks can be marked as completed by entering the index of the task.
6. Tasks can be removed by entering the index of the task.
7. The user can type 'exit' to close the To-Do List application.

# How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
    ```

2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

    ```bash
    g++ todo_list.cpp -o todo_list
    ```

3. Run the compiled executable.

    ```bash
    ./todo_list
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the To-Do List application.
